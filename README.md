## Introduction
Online video compression tools such as freeconvert.com often have limited upload file numbers and file size. Those tools are also incredibly slow due to free resources, or require subscription to unlock the limits. So why not we just use our own cpu and gpu to compress video?

## Compression
This program uses ffmpeg and hevc (h.265) encoder to compress videos.

## Compatibility
This is not tested at all, I only know it can run on my device hehe.

## Prerequisite
User must have [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed. (Window users must set FFMPEG to enviroment path, [HOW?](https://www.editframe.com/guides/how-to-install-and-start-using-ffmpeg-in-under-10-minutes))

## Installation and Usage
Download latest version of auto-compress from [Releases](https://github.com/roogue/auto-compress/releases), extract it and run the executable file. (Linux users are required to run the executable file with terminal, and cd into the program directory)
